<h4 id="AU">About us</h4>
<P>Agricultural machinery relates to the mechanical structures and devices used in farming or other agriculture. There are many types of such equipment, from hand tools and power tools to tractors and the countless kinds of farm implements that they tow or operate. Diverse arrays of equipment are used in both organic and nonorganic farming. Especially since the advent of mechanised agriculture, agricultural machinery is an indispensable part of how the world is fed. Agricultural machinery can be regarded as part of wider agricultural automation technologies, which includes the more advanced digital equipment and robotics.[1] While agricultural robots have the potential to automate the three key steps involved in any agricultural operation (diagnosis, decision-making and performing), conventional motorized machinery is used principally to automate only the performing step where diagnosis and decision-making are conducted by humans based on observations and experience.[1]  </P>

<h4 id="BC"> Brush cutter</h4>
<img src="Brush cutter.jpeg" height="200px" width="200px">
<p>A brushcutter (also called a brush saw, clearing saw or gasoline goat) is a powered garden or agricultural tool used to trim weeds, small trees, and other foliage not accessible by a lawn mower or rotary mower. Various blades or trimmer heads can be attached to the machine for specific applications.

  It consists of:
  
  A power unit held close to the body.
  A pole through which the power is transmitted.
  A rotary cutting head at the opposite end of the pole to the power unit.</p>

  <h4 id="PT">Power tiller</h4>
  <img src="power tiller.jpeg" height="200px" width="200px">
  <p>A tiller or till is a lever used to steer a vehicle. The mechanism is primarily used in watercraft, where it is attached to an outboard motor, rudder post or stock to provide leverage in the form of torque for the helmsman to turn the rudder. A tiller may also be used in vehicles outside of water, and was seen in early automobiles.

    On vessels, a tiller can be used by the helmsman directly pulling or pushing it, but it may also be moved remotely using tiller lines or a ship's wheel. Rapid or excessive movement of the tiller results in an increase in drag and will result in braking or slowing the boat.</p>
<h4 id="LI">Land imprinter</h4>
<img src="land imprinter.jpeg" height="200px" width="200px">
<p>The land imprinter[1] is a no-till device for establishing grass cover in arid environments and deserts. The imprinter consists of a metal roller, with steel angles welded to the surface in various configurations.[2] The angled teeth of the imprinter cut through weeds and brush to form a mulch, while the teeth press seeds of grasses and other plants into the soil. The imprints remain stable for approximately two years.[3] During that time, imprints funnel water toward seedlings, protect them from wind, and concentrate nutrients for plant growth.</p>
<h4 id="SD">Seed drill</h4>
<img src="seed drill.jpeg" height="200px" width="200px">
<p>A seed drill is a device used in agriculture that sows seeds for crops by positioning them in the soil and burying them to a specific depth while being dragged by a tractor. This ensures that seeds will be distributed evenly.

  The seed drill sows the seeds at the proper seeding rate and depth, ensuring that the seeds are covered by soil. This saves them from being eaten by birds and animals, or being dried up due to exposure to the sun. With seed drill machines, seeds are distributed in rows; this allows plants to get sufficient sunlight, nutrients from the soil.
  
  Before the introduction of the seed drill, most seeds were planted by hand broadcasting, an imprecise and wasteful process with a poor distribution of seeds and low productivity. Use of a seed drill can improve the ratio of crop yield (seeds harvested per seed planted) by as much as eight times. The use of seed drill saves time and labor.</p>
  <h4 id="PR">Planter</h4>
  <img src="planter.jpeg" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p>A planter is a farm implement, usually towed behind a tractor, that sows (plants) seeds in rows throughout a field.[1][2] It is connected to the tractor with a drawbar or a three-point hitch. Planters lay the seeds down in precise manner along rows. Planters vary greatly in size, from 1 row to 54, with the biggest in the world being the 48-row John Deere DB120. Such larger and newer planters comprise multiple modules called row units.[1] The row units are spaced evenly along the planter[1] at intervals that vary widely by crop and locale. The most common row spacing in the United States today is 30 inches.[1]</p>
  <h4 id="TR">Tractor</h4>
  <img src="tractor.jpeg" height="200px" width="200px">
  <p>A tractor is an engineering vehicle specifically designed to deliver a high tractive effort (or torque) at slow speeds, for the purposes of hauling a trailer or machinery such as that used in agriculture, mining or construction. Most commonly, the term is used to describe a farm vehicle that provides the power and traction to mechanize agricultural tasks, especially (and originally) tillage, and now many more. Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on the tractor, and the tractor may also provide a source of power if the implement is mechanised.</p>
  <h4 id="RR">Rice ruller</h4>
  <img src="rice huller.jpeg" height="200px" width="200px">
  <p>A rice huller or rice husker is an agricultural machine used to automate the process of removing the chaff (the outer husks) of grains of rice. Throughout history, there have been numerous techniques to hull rice. Traditionally, it would be pounded using some form of mortar and pestle. An early simple machine to do this is a rice pounder. Later even more efficient machinery was developed to hull and polish rice. These machines are most widely developed and used throughout Asia where the most popular type is the Engelberg huller designed by German Brazilian engineer Evaristo Conrado Engelberg in Brazil and first patented in 1885.[1]</p>
  <h4 id="FM">FLail mower</h4>
  <img src="Flail mower.jpeg" height="200px" width="200px">
  <p>A flail mower is a type of powered garden/agricultural equipment which is used to deal with heavier grass/scrub which a normal lawn mower could not cope with. Some smaller models are self-powered, but many are PTO driven implements, which can attach to the three-point hitches found on the rear of most tractors. This type of mower is best used to provide a rough cut to long grass and even brambles in locations such as roadsides, where contact with loose debris may be possible.</p>
<h4 id="ET">Edge trimmer</h4>
<img src="edge trimmer.jpeg" height="200px" width="200px">
<p>A hedge trimmer, shrub trimmer, or bush trimmer[1][2] is a gardening tool or machine used for trimming (cutting, pruning) hedges or solitary shrubs (bushes). Different designs as well as manual and powered versions of hedge trimmers exist. Hedge trimmers vary between small hand-held devices to larger trimmers mounted on tractors.</p>
<h4 id="TM">Threshing machine</h4>
<img src="Threshing machines.jpeg" height="200px" width="200px">
<p>A threshing machine or a thresher is a piece of farm equipment that separates grain seed from the stalks and husks. It does so by beating the plant to make the seeds fall out. Before such machines were developed, threshing was done by hand with flails: such hand threshing was very laborious and time-consuming, taking about one-quarter of agricultural labour by the 18th century.[1] Mechanization of this process removed a substantial amount of drudgery from farm labour. The first threshing machine was invented circa 1786 by the Scottish engineer Andrew Meikle, and the subsequent adoption of such machines was one of the earlier examples of the mechanization of agriculture. During the 19th century, threshers and mechanical reapers and reaper-binders gradually became widespread and made grain production much less laborious. </p><br>
